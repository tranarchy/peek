# About

This is a standalone mod of the Peek module from my [utility mod](https://github.com/tranarchy/nicotine)

This mod let's you see inside of shulker boxes and ender chests without opening them

Pressing `LEFT ALT` while your mouse is over a shulker box or an ender chest opens it inside of a container and let's you inspect the items
