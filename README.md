# About

This mod allows you to see inside of shulker boxes and ender chests without opening them

Pressing `LEFT ALT` while your mouse is over a shulker box or an ender chest opens it inside of a container and let's you inspect the items individually

NOTE: For the ender chest, you have to open it normally once to see it from your inventory
